I am writing about the medical security I wanted here, and I am going to share what I have studied and collected.

When I entered college, my goal at the time was to become a medical security expert. But the reality was very different. It seems that the medical security I wanted was not available and I was going in an unwanted way. So I decided. I hope that I will study on my own and share the data I have collected so far, and that medical security will be further developed and many people will be interested.

I became interested in medical security because I was a high school student and I wrote a medical-related article on my blog in 2019. I don't know if many people are not as interested in health care or if other fields are good, but I have a lot of power to study alone. Or I want to do research, but I think there are a lot of data in foreign schools. I think sharing like this will make a lot of information and medical safer.

If you are also interested in medical security, please study and share like me.
