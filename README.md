I am writing about the medical security I wanted here, and I am going to share what I have studied and collected.

When I entered college, my goal at the time was to become a medical security expert. But the reality was very different. It seems that the medical security I wanted was not available and I was going in an unwanted way. So I decided. I hope that I will study on my own and share the data I have collected so far, and that medical security will be further developed and many people will be interested.

If you are also interested in medical security, please study and share like me.
